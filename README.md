# NoSQL-Challenge
This repository is for the Data Analytics Bootcamp Module 12 Challenge

I began this challenge by using PyMongo to import the data within establishments.json (found in Resources) into the NoSQL_setup_starter Jupyer Notebook file. Once the data was in a Mongo database, I was able to parse, add, delete, and manipulate the data. 

After cleaning the data and changing data types of some of the fields, I moved into the analysis portion of this assignment in the NoSQL_analysis_starter Jupyer Notebook file. I structered several queries to drill down into the data and pull specific information, then used Pandas to put these queries into DataFrames. Finally, I was able to contruct an aggregation pipeline to find the number of establishments by Local Authority that fit within certain parameters. 

I referenced class activities and instruction provided by Instructor Brett Barnes and TA Ally Qi to complete this activity.
